Goal of the Project:
In class 132, we have calculated the gravity value and added that into our dataset.
In this project we are going to plot various graphs and visualise the data and see how one
quantity is affected by the other.
** This is a continuation of the project we did for Classes 127, 128, 129, 130, and 131.
Please complete those projects before attempting this project **
Getting Started:
Open your VS Code editor and continue with the project.
Specific Tasks to complete the Project:
1. Import the data from the csv file, make sure you have gravity data as well.
2. Create lists of mass, radius and gravity data.
3. Sort the list using sort() method.
4. Using Matplotlib, create charts between, mass and radius.
    ● Add labels and titles in the chart.
5. Create a chart of mass and gravity also.
*Refer to the images given above for reference.
Submitting the Project:
1. Upload your completed project to your own github account
2. Create a new repository named “Plotting Graphs”.
3. Upload working code to this github repository.
